# Gregorian Calendar Generator #

## Introduction ##

This project generates a Gregorian calendar for each month of a given year and
outputs it into a static HTML file. The previous year and the following year
are also generated and oututted to the HTML file.

The Gregorian calendar was introduced in October 1582 as a modification to the 
Julian calendar. Therefore, this generator supports October 1852 and onwards.
